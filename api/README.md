Create a file called `api.yml`. `api-sample.yml` should help you create this file.

Run `make test` to ensure all tests pass. Run `make coverage` and `make coverage-total` to ensure adaquete code coverage. `main.go` and `internal/test-utils/*` are except from coverage scanning and do not have any tests.

You can use `make lint` to ensure your changes conform to the code standards.
