## Security

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any application owned, hosted or managed by me, please report it to me as described below.

Do not be afraid to report security issues. I would rather spend time investigating a potential security issue then let one roam free.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Send your email to [security@mcgov.ie](mailto:security@mcgov.ie)

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English. Mura bhfuil tú ag iarraidh an Béarla a usaid, is féidir leat teagmháil a dhéanamh liom trí Ghaeilge.
